# PyPong
PyPong is a classic Pong game built using Python (library: Pygame). Players can enjoy single-player mode against "AI" or multiplayer mode with two players. The goal is to hit the ball with paddles and score points by getting the ball past the opponent. The game includes retro graphics, sound effects, dynamic gameplay and an extreme endless mode.
